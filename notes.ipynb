    "## 3. U.S. Stock Market Bubble Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stock Market Decline Process**\n",
    "- Initial optimism and high market sentiment create bubbles.\n",
    "- Unexpected events can burst bubbles (e.g., COVID-19, 2008 housing crisis).\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Bubble Identification Criteria**\n",
    "1. **Extreme Valuations:** \n",
    "   - P/B ratio of value stocks relative to the market.\n",

    "## 2. Understanding Stagflation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition of Stagflation**\n",
    "- Occurs when economic stagnation (low GDP growth, rising unemployment) coincides with high inflation.\n",
    "- Key indicators:\n",
    "  - **Stagnation:** Declining GDP, weak investment, rising unemployment.\n",
    "  - **Inflation:** Persistent price increases well above targets.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Asset Performance During Stagflation**\n",
    "- **Gold & Commodities:** Performed well due to inflation hedging.\n",
    "- **Stocks & Bonds:** Struggled due to tight monetary policy expectations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Comparing Current Economy to 1970s**\n",
    "- **More Effective Monetary Policy:** \n",
    "  - Clear inflation targeting (2% goal established in 2012).\n",
